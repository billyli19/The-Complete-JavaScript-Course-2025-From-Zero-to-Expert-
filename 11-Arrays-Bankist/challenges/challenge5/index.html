      <h1>Challenge 5</h1>
      <p>
        Julia and Kate are still studying dogs. This time they are want to
        figure out if the dogs in their are eating too much or too little food.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Formula for calculating recommended food portion: recommendedFood =
          weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food, and the weight
          needs to be in kg)
        </li>
        <li>
          Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than
          the recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a
          range 10% above and below the recommended portion (see hint).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>YOUR TASKS:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Loop over the array containing dog objects, and for each dog,
          calculate the recommended food portion (recFood) and add it to the
          object as a new property. Do NOT create a new array, simply loop over
          the array (We never did this before, so think about how you can do
          this without creating a new array).
        </li>
        <li>
          Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much
          or too little. HINT: Some dogs have multiple users, so you first need
          to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on
          purpose) ðŸ¤“
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
          (ownersTooMuch) and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too
          little (ownersTooLittle).
        </li>
        <li>
          Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this:
          "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John
          and Michael's dogs eat too little!"
        </li>
        <li>
          Log to the console whether there is ANY dog eating EXACTLY the amount
          of food that is recommended (just true or false)
        </li>
        <li>
          Log to the console whether ALL of the dogs are eating an OKAY amount
          of food (just true or false)
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an OKAY amount of
          food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Group the dogs into the following 3 groups: 'exact', 'too-much' and
          'too-little', based on whether they are eating too much, too little or
          the exact amount of food, based on the recommended food portion.
        </li>
        <li>Group the dogs by the number of owners they have</li>
        <li>
          Sort the dogs array by recommended food portion in an ascending order.
          Make sure to NOT mutate the original array!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          HINT 1: Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can
          use the summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰
        </li>
        <li>
          HINT 2: Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended
          portion means: current > (recommended * 0.90) && current <
          (recommended * 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between
          90% and 110% of the recommended portion.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>TEST DATA:</p>
      <p>
        const dogs = [ { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ['Alice', 'Bob'] }, {
        weight: 8, curFood: 200, owners: ['Matilda'] }, { weight: 13, curFood:
        275, owners: ['Sarah', 'John', 'Leo'] }, { weight: 18, curFood: 244,
        owners: ['Joe'] }, { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners: ['Michael'] }, ];
      </p>
      <p>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</p>

      <h1>Challenge 2</h1>
      <p>
        Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want
        to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the
        dogs in their study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of
        dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if
          the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2
          years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the
          same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already
          know from other challenges how we calculate averages ðŸ˜‰)
        </li>
        <li>Run the function for both test datasets</li>
      </ol>
      <p>TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]</p>
      <p>TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]</p>
      <p>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</p>

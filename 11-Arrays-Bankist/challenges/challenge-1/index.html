    <h1>Challenge 1</h1>
    <p>
      Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog
      owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array
      for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is
      an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and
      it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
      ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs
        actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array,
        and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad
        practice to mutate function parameters)
      </li>
      <li>Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data</li>
      <li>
        For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog
        number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is
        still a puppy üê∂")
      </li>
      <li>Run the function for both test datasets</li>
    </ol>
    <p>HINT: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far üòâ</p>
    <p>
      TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
    </p>
    <p>
      TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
    </p>
    <p>GOOD LUCK üòÄ</p>

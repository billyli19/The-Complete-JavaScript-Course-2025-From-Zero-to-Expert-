      <h1>Challenge 4</h1>
      <p>
        This time, Julia and Kate are studying the activity levels of different
        dog breeds.
      </p>
      <p>YOUR TASKS:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Store the the average weight of a "Husky" in a variable "huskyWeight"
        </li>
        <li>
          Find the name of the only breed that likes both "running" and "fetch"
          ("dogBothActivities" variable)
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an array "allActivities" of all the activities of all the dog
          breeds
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an array "uniqueActivities" that contains only the unique
          activities (no activity repetitions). HINT: Use a technique with a
          special data structure that we studied a few sections ago.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many dog breeds like to swim. What other activities do these dogs
          like? Store all the OTHER activities these breeds like to do, in a
          unique array called "swimmingAdjacent".
        </li>
        <li>
          Do all the breeds have an average weight of 10kg or more? Log to the
          console whether "true" or "false".
        </li>
        <li>
          Are there any breeds that are "active"? "Active" means that the dog
          has 3 or more activities. Log to the console whether "true" or
          "false".
        </li>
        <li>
          BONUS: What's the average weight of the heaviest breed that likes to
          fetch? HINT: Use the "Math.max" method along with the ... operator.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>TEST DATA:</p>
      <p>
        const breeds = [ { breed: 'German Shepherd', averageWeight: 32,
        activities: ['fetch', 'swimming'], }, { breed: 'Dalmatian',
        averageWeight: 24, activities: ['running', 'fetch', 'agility'], }, {
        breed: 'Labrador', averageWeight: 28, activities: ['swimming', 'fetch'],
        }, { breed: 'Beagle', averageWeight: 12, activities: ['digging',
        'fetch'], }, { breed: 'Husky', averageWeight: 26, activities:
        ['running', 'agility', 'swimming'], }, { breed: 'Bulldog',
        averageWeight: 36, activities: ['sleeping'], }, { breed: 'Poodle',
        averageWeight: 18, activities: ['agility', 'fetch'], }, ];
